## Instructions

As can be seen, I created the system using Laravel 5.8 because the website is hosted on Hostgator server which does not support the latest version of Laravel. For the database, I used migrations and the method seeders,  so that I am going to put the prompt commands to run the system perfectly.
On this project, I used MySQL database

PS: Prepare the file .env before running the command below, in order to run the migration correctly.

- composer update
- php artisan key: generate
- php artisan migrate:refresh --seed

To properly storage the images it is necessary to run the command below
- php artisan storage:link


## About the project

First of all, I am very glad for the opportunity of coding for your company and overcoming this challenge. I put a lot of effort into finalizing it, however, due to my familiarity with Laravel, I performed it fastly.

Thank you very much for the opportunity to show my job. I look forward to hearing from you.
